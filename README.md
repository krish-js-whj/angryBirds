# AngryBirds just play normally and score
Introducing constraints

Call Matter libraries
Predefine box, pig, bird, slingshot, give positions, images give score for reducing visibility of box and pig (breaking it) and ground

Create many such logs and pigs 

See if mouse is dragged, released and give set to slingshot or fly etc

if space is pressed reset to slingshot

if collides with box and pig increase score 



note might be bigs will fix fs
